# CosmicBlaster

Hi!

Welcome to Cosmic Blaster, a Multiplayer shooter game!
Most of the code is courtesy of Stephen Ulibarri, from his Multiplayer Shooter course on Udemy.
But I have added a lot of my own code and changed some of the original code to suit my own game design.

I have tried to make note in my commits where I have personalised things so hopefully it's clear!

I learnt so much in completing this course and I'm so proud of what I have achieved here, I hope you like it!
